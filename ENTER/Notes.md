The customers of SilverNest are primarily two groups: homeowners who live alone in their own houses but can no longer afford the upkeep and maintenance, and individuals seeking affordable housing options.

For homeowners, SilverNest helps them find compatible housemates who will share upkeep and maintenance costsâ€”and potentially assist with those tasks or contribute in other helpful ways.

For renters, the service enables them to live in a desirable neighborhood they couldn't otherwise afford, while also fostering a less isolated lifestyle.

Ultimately, SilverNest customers benefit from a platform that matches them with vetted, compatible housemates, complete with background checks to ensure security and peace of mind.
