## The 4 Ps of Marketing

*   **Product:** What you offer to the market.
*   **Price:** The cost consumers pay for your product or service.
*   **Place (Distribution):** How your product gets to the consumer.
*   **Promotion:** Activities to communicate and persuade customers to buy.
## Forms of Market Segmentation

Market segmentation involves dividing a broad consumer market into sub-groups based on shared characteristics. The level of differentiation increases from mass to individual segmentation.

*   **Mass Marketing:**
    *   **Description:** Product is almost identical with little to no differentiation (e.g., generic fruit).
    *   **Focus:** Price, basic features.
*   **Segment Marketing:**
    *   **Description:** More differentiation, targeting a larger group with similar needs (e.g., ketchup brands).
    *   **Focus:** Price, features, benefits/taste.
*   **Niche Marketing:**
    *   **Description:** Targets a small, unique group with very specific needs (e.g., EcoMax laundry detergent).
    *   **Characteristics:** Unique pricing strategy (often more expensive), higher differentiation.
*   **Individual Marketing (One-to-One Marketing):**
    *   **Description:** Highest level of differentiation, customized for individual customers (e.g., names on Coke bottles, custom engraving, tailored clothing).
    *   **Focus:** How the product is marketed and customized, rather than just the core product itself.

## Environmental Marketing Scan

An environmental scan is a crucial first step in strategic planning.

### Definition and Purpose

*   **Definition:** Continually acquiring information on events occurring outside an organization to identify external trends.
*   **Purpose:** To identify opportunities or threats to a business. Often the first step in developing a more extensive SWOT analysis.

### CRESTD Analysis (Environmental Forces)

This framework helps categorize and analyze external factors:

1.  **Demographic Forces:** Changes in population characteristics.
    *   Census data points: Age, location (urban/rural), ethnic group, income, marital status/household makeup.
2.  **Socio-Cultural Forces:** Shifts in societal values and behaviors.
    *   Changes in: Societal values, beliefs, attitudes, preferences, media usage, diet.
3.  **Economic Forces:** Impact of economic conditions on consumer spending and business operations.
    *   **Micro-economic:** Consumer spending (resource allocation, scarcity).
    *   **Macro-economic:** Economy as a whole (GDP, inflation rate - potential recession, unemployment rate).
4.  **Technological Changes:** Advances and innovations.
    *   Examples: AI, social media, hybrid work models, device connectivity.
5.  **Competitive Forces:** The landscape of direct and indirect rivals.
    *   **Direct Competition:** Businesses offering similar products/services.
    *   **Indirect Competition:** Substitutes for your product (e.g., a bike for a car ride).
6.  **Regulatory Forces:** Laws and rules governing business and marketing decisions.
    *   Examples: Advertising laws, product safety regulations, privacy policies.

### SWOT Analysis (Internal & External Assessment)

A strategic planning tool used to evaluate internal and external factors:

| Internal     | External       |
| :----------- | :------------- |
| **Strengths**  | **Opportunities** |
| **Weaknesses** | **Threats**     |

### Steps in an Environmental Scan

1.  **Collection of facts and identification of trends:** Gather relevant data.
2.  **Determine the impact:** Analyze how these facts/trends will affect the business.
3.  **Brainstorm, evaluate, and implement ideas:** Develop strategies to meet business objectives based on the findings.

## Market Research
