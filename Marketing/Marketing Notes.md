## The 4 Ps of Marketing

*   **Product:** What an organization offers to its target market, including features, branding, packaging, and services.
*   **Price:** The monetary value consumers exchange for acquiring the product or service. This includes list price, discounts, allowances, and payment terms.
*   **Place (Distribution):** How the product reaches the consumer, encompassing channels, logistics, inventory, and[[scratchpad]] coverage.
*   **Promotion:** Activities undertaken to communicate the product's value and persuade customers to purchase. This includes advertising, public relations, sales promotion, and personal selling.

## Forms of Market Segmentation

Market segmentation involves dividing a broad consumer market into distinct sub-groups based on shared characteristics. The level of product differentiation and targeting specificity increases progressively from mass to individual marketing.

*   **Mass Marketing:**
    *   **Description:** A single product offering with minimal to no differentiation, aiming to appeal to the entire market (e.g., generic commodities like certain fruits or basic utilities).
    *   **Focus:** Emphasizes broad appeal, efficiency, and often price.
*   **Segment Marketing:**
    *   **Description:** Developing distinct products or marketing mixes for larger, identifiable groups within the market that share similar needs or characteristics (e.g., different ketchup brands appealing to varying taste preferences or dietary needs).
    *   **Focus:** Targets specific segments with tailored features, benefits, and pricing.
*   **Niche Marketing:**
    *   **Description:** Focusing marketing efforts on a small, unique, and often specialized group of consumers with very specific needs that are not well-served by mass or segment marketers (e.g., EcoMax laundry detergent targeting environmentally conscious consumers seeking specific ingredients).
    *   **Characteristics:** High differentiation, often commanding a premium price due to specialized offerings.
*   **Individual Marketing (One-to-One Marketing):**
    *   **Description:** The highest level of differentiation, where products or marketing messages are customized for individual customers (e.g., personalized product packaging like names on Coke bottles, custom-engraved items, or bespoke tailoring).
    *   **Focus:** Emphasizes individual customization and a highly personalized customer experience rather than a standardized core product.

## Environmental Marketing Scan

An environmental scan is a critical initial step in strategic planning, enabling organizations to proactively respond to external forces.

### Definition and Purpose

*   **Definition:** The continuous process of gathering and interpreting information about events and trends occurring outside an organization.
*   **Purpose:** To identify potential opportunities or threats to the business. It serves as a foundational step for more comprehensive analyses, such as a SWOT analysis.

### CRESTD Analysis (Environmental Forces)

This framework categorizes and analyzes the key external forces impacting an organization:

1.  **Demographic Forces:** Changes in population characteristics that influence market size and consumer behavior.
    *   **Factors:** Age distribution, geographic location (urbanization, migration), ethnic composition, income levels, education, marital status, and household makeup.
2.  **Socio-Cultural Forces:** Shifts in societal values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that affect consumer preferences and lifestyles.
    *   **Factors:** Evolving societal values, cultural norms, health consciousness, media consumption habits, dietary trends, and ethical considerations.
3.  **Economic Forces:** The impact of economic conditions on consumer purchasing power and overall business operations.
    *   **Micro-economic:** Factors affecting individual consumer spending patterns, resource allocation, and scarcity.
    *   **Macro-economic:** Broader economic indicators like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation rates (potential for recession), interest rates, and unemployment levels.
4.  **Technological Changes:** Advances and innovations that create new products, services, production methods, and communication channels.
    *   **Examples:** Artificial intelligence (AI), social media platforms, proliferation of hybrid work models, and increasing device connectivity (IoT).
5.  **Competitive Forces:** The landscape of direct and indirect rivals influencing market dynamics and strategic positioning.
    *   **Direct Competition:** Businesses offering similar products or services that directly compete for the same customer base.
    *   **Indirect Competition:** Products or services that serve as substitutes, fulfilling the same basic need through different means (e.g., public transport or a bicycle as an alternative to owning a car).
6.  **Regulatory Forces:** Laws, regulations, and governmental policies that govern business practices and marketing decisions.
    *   **Examples:** Advertising standards, product safety regulations, consumer privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and environmental protection acts.

### SWOT Analysis (Internal & External Assessment)

A strategic planning tool used to evaluate both internal capabilities and external conditions:

| Internal     | External       |
| :----------- | :------------- |
| **Strengths**  | **Opportunities** |
| **Weaknesses** | **Threats**     |

### Steps in an Environmental Scan

1.  **Collection of Facts and Identification of Trends:** Systematically gather relevant data and identify emerging patterns.
2.  **Determine the Impact:** Analyze how these identified facts and trends could specifically affect the business.
3.  **Brainstorm, Evaluate, and Implement Ideas:** Develop strategic responses, assess their viability, and integrate them into business objectives and actions.

## Market Research

### What is Market Research?

Market research is the systematic process of defining a marketing problem or opportunity, collecting and analyzing relevant information, and recommending actions to improve marketing decisions and reduce risk.

### Five Steps of Market Research

#### 1. Define the Problem or Opportunity

*   **Objective Setting:** Clearly articulate the specific marketing problem or opportunity that needs to be addressed.
*   **Measurable Goals:** Establish clear, quantifiable objectives for the research, such as increasing market share by a certain percentage or achieving specific profit targets. These goals provide objectivity and a benchmark for success.

#### 2. Develop the Research Plan

*   **Research Design:** Formulate a plan that ensures the research is relevant, aligns with company objectives, and is feasible.
*   **Sampling Strategy:** Determine the methods for selecting an accurate and representative sample from the target population to ensure the research findings can be generalized.

#### 3. Collect Relevant Data

Data can be categorized by its origin and purpose:

*   **Primary Data:** Facts and figures newly collected specifically for the current research project by the researcher.
*   **Secondary Data:** Facts and figures that have already been collected, analyzed, and are publicly available or accessible.
    *   **Internal Data:** Information originating from within the company (e.g., sales reports, customer databases).
    *   **External Data:** Information published by sources outside the company (e.g., government statistics, industry reports, academic studies).

*   **Advantages of Using Primary Data:**
    *   More current and directly relevant to the specific research problem.
    *   Allows for definitions and categories tailored to the project's exact needs.
    *   Often more accurate and specific compared to general secondary data.

*   **Methods for Finding Primary Data:**
    *   **Qualitative Research (Exploratory):**
        *   **Focus Groups:** Small groups of people led by a moderator to discuss a product or concept.
        *   **In-Depth Interviews:** One-on-one conversations to explore individual perspectives in detail.
        *   **Online Research Communities:** Dedicated online platforms for ongoing engagement with target consumers.
        *   **Social Listening:** Monitoring social media and online conversations to understand consumer sentiment and trends.

    *   **Quantitative Research (Descriptive & Causal):**
        *   **Observational Research:** Systematically observing and recording patterns of behavior, objects, or events.
        *   **Surveys/Questionnaires:** Collecting data through structured sets of questions, often via online, phone, or in-person methods.
        *   **Experiments:** Manipulating one or more independent variables to measure their effect on a dependent variable, often used to test cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., A/B testing).

*   **Mistakes to Avoid When Writing Survey Questions:**
    *   **Leading or Loaded Questions:** Questions that suggest a preferred answer or are emotionally biased.
    *   **Non-Specific Questions:** Vague questions that do not yield clear or actionable responses.
    *   **Missing Options:** Excluding plausible answer choices from multiple-choice questions.
    *   **Double-Barreled Questions:** Asking two distinct questions at the same time.
    *   **Confusing Wording:** Using jargon, complex sentence structures, or ambiguous terms.

*   **Test Markets:** Controlled experiments conducted in a limited geographic area to assess consumer reactions to new product introductions or promotional offers under realistic market conditions.
    *   **Benefits:** Provides a more realistic evaluation of potential success.
    *   **Drawbacks:** Can be time-consuming, costly, and visible to competitors.
    *   **Types:** Can involve actual in-market trials or simulated test markets.

#### 4. Develop Findings

*   **Data Analysis:** Process and interpret the collected data to extract meaningful insights.
*   **Metrics:** Utilize numerical data points that are collected and grouped to track performance effectively. Metrics should be easy to understand and consistently monitored.
    *   **Market Share:** The percentage of total sales volume for a product or brand relative to the entire sales volume of its competing category, tracked over time and compared to competitors.
