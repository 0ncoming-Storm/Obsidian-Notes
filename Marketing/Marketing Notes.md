*   **Product:** What you offer to the market.

## 2.2. Marketing Assignment: How to Market

Here's how to approach marketing for various entities:

*   **A Fancy Perfume:** Emphasize luxury, exclusivity, sensory experience, aspirational lifestyle, and brand image.

## 6.3. Forms of Market Segmentation

Market segmentation involves dividing a broad consumer market into sub-groups based on shared characteristics. The level of differentiation increases from mass to individual segmentation.

*   **Mass Marketing:**
    *   **Description:** Product is almost identical with little to no differentiation (e.g., generic fruit).
    *   **Focus:** Price, basic features.
*   **Segment Marketing:**
    *   **Description:** More differentiation, targeting a larger group with similar needs (e.g., ketchup brands).
    *   **Focus:** Price, features, benefits/taste.
*   **Niche Marketing:**
    *   **Description:** Targets a small, unique group with very specific needs (e.g., EcoMax laundry detergent).
    *   **Characteristics:** Unique pricing strategy (often more expensive), higher differentiation.
*   **Individual Marketing (One-to-One Marketing):**
    *   **Description:** Highest level of differentiation, customized for individual customers (e.g., names on Coke bottles, custom engraving, tailored clothing).
    *   **Focus:** How the product is marketed and customized, rather than just the core product itself.
